# Changelog

All notable changes to Temper are documented here. The plugin version lives in
`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.

## v5.1.0 — Nested Subagent Support

- **Nested agents config:** Added `agents` block to `.claude/temper.config` with
  `nested`, `max-depth`, `parallel-width`, and `on-budget-exhausted` settings.
  Defaults to `max-depth: 4`, `parallel-width: 3`, graceful inline fallback.
- **Depth budget governance:** Updated orchestrator-patterns.md to pass
  `depth_remaining` to stage agents. Stages check budget before spawning:
  `depth_remaining > 1` → spawn, `depth_remaining <= 1` → run inline.
- **Depth-2 helpers enabled:** Review parallel subagents, Plan Explore auto-prime,
  Fix Explore RCA, and architecture-depth Explore now work in the composed
  `/temper` pipeline (previously degraded when run through orchestrator).
- **Graceful degradation:** Depth exhaustion falls back to inline work instead
  of hard failure. Deterministic local budgeting; no global tree state needed.
- **ADR-0002:** Documented nested subagent support strategy in
  `docs/decisions/0002-nested-subagent-support.md`.

## v5.0.1 — Token optimization

- **Orchestrator dedup:** `temper.md` and `fix.md` now delegate repeated
  build-state schemas, gate-enforcement prose, context-file schemas, feedback-loop
  schemas, and stage-agent launch scaffolding to a single canonical definition in
  `reference/orchestrator-patterns.md` instead of re-inlining them per stage.
- **Single-load contract:** orchestrators read `orchestrator-patterns.md` once at
  start; all `→ pattern` references point into that already-loaded file (no re-reads).
- **Progressive loading:** `reference/review.md` and `reference/plan.md` gained a
  Progressive Loading Map so stage agents load core sections first and pull optional
  sections only when their trigger fires. Duplicated optional methodology (arch-depth,
  HTML review) trimmed to references.
- **Lean memory:** `.claude/CLAUDE.md` trimmed to the command table + pointers; version
  history moved here, token insights moved to `reference/tokenomics.md`.
